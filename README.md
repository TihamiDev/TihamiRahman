**Projects**


- **Smart Contact Manager**

*Technologies*: Spring Boot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Spring Security

A full-fledged contact management system with features such as user authentication, 
role-based access control, and seamless integration of front-end and back-end components.
The system is designed to handle secure data storage and retrieval using Hibernate, while Spring Boot provides a powerful framework for API management.


- **CoinDCX WebSocket API Project**

*Technologies*: Spring Boot, WebSocket, REST API

This project involved integrating with the CoinDCX WebSocket API to fetch real-time trading data.
The application allows users to input specific trigger prices and then processes order operations based on that data.
Built using Spring Boot for server-side logic and WebSocket for real-time updates, this project showcases the efficient 
handling of high-volume data flows.


- **Note Maker Application**

*Technologies*: Java, JSP, Hibernate, Angular

Developed a robust note-taking application allowing users to create, update, and delete notes with a simple and intuitive 
interface. This project highlights my ability to work with Java-based technologies on the backend, combined with Angular 
for dynamic, responsive front-end features.


- **Pizza Billing Software (Practice Project)**

*Technologies*: Core Java, Collections, Arrays

This console-based project was built to improve my understanding of data structures and logic-building with Java. The
application manages pizza orders, handles billing operations, and demonstrates the use of Java’s Collections and Arrays
for efficient data processing.


- **EduSynth (ERP for Educational Institutions)**

*Technologies*: Laravel, HTML, MySQL

Developed a fully functional ERP system tailored for educational institutions to manage student data, academic schedules,
and faculty information. I worked extensively on the front end and database integration.

Achievement: Scored 91% in my final year project for delivering a comprehensive solution with dynamic data management features.


**Experience**
 
- **Java Developer Intern**

During my internship, I worked on the development of a Note Maker Application, where I integrated Java, JSP,
Hibernate, and Angular. The project required full-stack capabilities, and I was responsible for creating an 
efficient backend with robust CRUD functionality and a dynamic front-end interface.



- **Certifications & Achievements**

Scored 91% in my final year project, EduSynth.

Successfully developed real-time API applications like the CoinDCX WebSocket API Project.

Demonstrated expertise in full-stack Java development through projects like the Smart Contact Manager and Note Maker Application.
